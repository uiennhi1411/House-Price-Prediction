# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features collected from [batdongsan.vn](https://batdongsan.vn). The workflow includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and building machine learning models to make accurate predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is scraped from [batdongsan.vn](https://batdongsan.vn) and saved as `housePrice.csv`. It includes various features relevant to house prices.

## Notebooks
The project is organized into the following Jupyter notebooks:

1. **[Data Collection and Feature Engineering.ipynb](Data%20Collection%20and%20Feature%20Engineering.ipynb)**
   - **Purpose:** Scrape data from the website and perform initial feature engineering tasks such as handling missing data, removing outliers, and creating new features.
2. **[Preprocessing_Visual.ipynb](Data%20Preprocessing.ipynb)**
   - **Purpose:** Conduct data preprocessing tasks and visualize the data to understand distributions and relationships between features.

3. **[Model.ipynb](Model.ipynb)**
   - **Purpose:** Develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting house prices.
